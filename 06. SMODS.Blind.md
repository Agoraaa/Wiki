# API Documentation: SMODS.Blind
- **Required parameters:**
	- `key`
	- `loc_txt`, Skeleton:
	```lua
		{
			name = '',
			text = { '' },
		}
	```
- **Optional parameters** *(defaults)*:
	- `dollars = 5`, the amount of money obtained when defeated,
	- `mult = 2`, the required score relative to the base Ante score,
	- `boss`, to mark this Blind as a Boss Blind, and to specify on which Antes it may appear (`{ min = 1, max = 10 }`),
	- `showdown`, to mark this Blind as a Final Boss Blind that shows up on every multiple of the winning Ante.
	- `pos = { x = 0, y = 0 }`, the `y` value determines the row to use for the animation,
	- `atlas = 'blind_chips'`,
	- `discovered = false`,
	- `vars = {}`, default variables for the debuff text when game data isn't available,
	- `debuff = {}`, for direct use of vanilla Blind effects with custom parameters:
		- Disallowing hands in full:
			- `hand = { ['Hand Type'] = true}` for a specific set of hands,
			- `h_size_ge = n`, must play at least `n` cards,
			- `h_size_le = n`, must play at most `n` cards.
		- Debuffing cards:
			- `suit = 'Hearts'` for one specific suit,
			- `value = '2'` for one specific rank,
			- `nominal = n` for all ranks scoring `n` base chips,
			- `is_face = true` for all face cards.
		- Note that these effects are disabled if you specify a `debuff_hand` or `debuff_card` function respectively.
