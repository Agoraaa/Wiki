	- `sound = { sound = "foil1", per = 1.2, vol = 0.4 }`, used to set a custom sound when the edition is applied

## API methods
- `loc_vars(self, info_queue) -> { vars ?= table }`
	- Used for passing variables to edition descriptions.
- `get_weight(self) ->  number `
	- Used to modify the weight of edition on certain conditions.

## Other information
### SMODS.Shader
A shader is required for a custom edition.
- **Required parameters:**
	- `key`
	- `path`, the file name of your shader. Shaders must be stored in `assets/shaders/` and be a `.fs` file. The name of your file **must** be the name of your shader.



### Weight System
The default game editions have the following weights
```
negative = 3
polychrome = 3 (takes negative's weight in some circumstances)
holographic = 14
foil = 20
```
The base chance for an edition to appear in the shop is 4%, thus there is a 2% chance for a foil joker to appear. Adding custom editions to the shop maintains this 4% chance. Therefore, if you add an edition with a weight of 40, it will have a 2% chance to spawn, and foil will be reduced to 1% chance.

When the Hone and Glow Up vouchers are purchased, the weights of the base editions are adjusted. Custom editions do not have this bonus applied by default. This means that the vouchers do not increase the edition chances to 8%/16%, but rather increase the chances of the default editions by 2X and 4X respectively. To add your edition to the Hone and Glow Up functionality, add this to your edition definition.
```lua
get_weight = function(self)
	return G.GAME.edition_rate * self.weight
end
```

### Edition methods
- `Card:set_edition(edition, immediate, silent)`
	- `edition`, `nil` removes edition, `key` of edition as a string
	- `immediate`, *boolean*
	- `silent`, *boolean*
Use this function to set the edition of a card

- `poll_edition(_key, _mod, _no_neg, _guaranteed, _options)` *(defaults)*
	- `_key = edition_generic`, *string* - key value for a random seed
	- `_mod = 1`, *number* - scale of chance against base card
	- `_no_neg = false`, *boolean* - disables negative edition chance *(chance is added to polychrome)*
	- `_guaranteed = false`, *boolean* - disables base card
	- `_options = all editions marked in_shop`, *table* - List of editions to poll. Two variations.
	Option 1 - list of keys for included editions. This method respects defined weights,
	```lua
	{"e_foil", "e_holo","e_negative"}
	```
	Option 2 - table of keys and weights. Used to override default weights,
	```lua
	{
		e_foil = 1,
		e_holo = 1,
		e_negative = 1
	}
	```
