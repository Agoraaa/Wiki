# Getting started
## Installing Lovely
Steamodded is built on **Lovely**, a runtime Lua injector for LÃ–VE2D games. Please follow the installation instructions for your operating system [here](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector).

## Installing Steamodded
**If you previously installed Steamodded without Lovely,** you must first remove that installation by verifying your game files on Steam: `Library > Balatro > Properties > Installed Files > Verify integrity of game files`.

### Direct download
1. Head to the [Release page](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/releases) and select the latest release.
2. Within the `Assets` header, choose **Source code (zip)**.
3. Extract the downloaded zip file.
4. In your file explorer, navigate to Balatro's save directory: **Windows:** `%AppData%/Balatro`; **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Balatro`; **Linux (WINE/Proton):** `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2379780/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Balatro`.
5. Create a directory named `Mods` inside the save directory if it doesn't already exist, and navigate to it.
6. Move the interior `Steamodded-1.x.x` folder from the download into `Mods`. Make sure that you don't have two Steamodded folders inside each other: your file structure should not look like this (`Balatro/Mods/Steamodded-1.x.x/Steamodded-1.x.x/core/core.lua`), but like this (`Balatro/Mods/Steamodded-1.x.x/core/core.lua`).
7. To update to a new version, delete the `Steamodded-1.x.x` directory in `Mods` and repeat steps 1-6.

### Using the command line (requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
1. Navigate to Balatro's save directory: **Windows:** `cd %AppData%/Balatro`; **Mac:** `cd ~/Library/Application Support/Balatro`; **Linux (WINE/Proton):** `cd ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2379780/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Balatro`
2. Create the `Mods` directory if it doesn't already exist, and nagivate to it: `mkdir Mods & cd Mods`
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded.git && cd Steamodded`
4. Access a specific release `1.x.x`: `git fetch --all && git checkout tags/1.x.x -b 1.x.x & git checkout 1.x.x`
5. If you want to test upcoming features in the beta phase, you can do so by using the `main` branch instead: `git checkout main`. To update to the latest commit, run `git pull`.

## Creating your first mod
### File header
For Steamodded to recognize your mod, the first line in your mod file must be exactly `--- STEAMODDED HEADER`. Have it be any different, and your mod will not load. Additionally, the following pieces of optional or required information about your mod are supported by the Loader. They need not be specified in any particular order.
- Required:
	- `--- MOD_NAME: Example Mod`
	- `--- MOD_ID: ExampleMod` (**Must be unique and without spaces**)
	- `--- MOD_AUTHOR: [You, AnotherDev, AnotherOtherDev]` (**Brackets are required**)
	- `--- MOD_DESCRIPTION: A description of your mod.` (**No line breaks, text is wrapped automatically.**)
- Optional:
	- `--- PRIORITY: -100` (**Large negative values go first, large positive values go last**)
	- `--- BADGE_COLOR: 123456` or `--- BADGE_COLOUR: ABCDEF`
	- `--- DISPLAY_NAME: Example` (**Shown on mod badges instead of your mod's name**)
	- `--- DEPENDENCIES: [Mod1, Mod2>=1.0.0, Mod3<=1.7.5, Mod4>=1.0.0<=2.0]`
	- `--- CONFLICTS: [Mod5, Mod6<=0.9.9, Mod7>=0.6.2, Mod8<=1.0>=0.3.7]`
	- `--- PREFIX: example` (**Must be unique. Defaults to the first 4 letters of your mod's ID.**)
	- `--- VERSION: 1.0.0`
    - `--- LOADER_VERSION_GEQ: 1.1.0` (**Requires Steamodded of this version or newer**)
	- `--- LOADER_VERSION_LEQ: 1.2.0` (**Requires Steamodded of this version or older**)

## Useful resources
- Often times, a functionality you want to use has already been implemented in the base game. As such, familiarizing yourself with the game's code is an important step to learning Balatro modding. To retrieve the source code, you simply need to extract the game's executable file with [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). For Mac, create a copy of `Balatro.app` and rename it to `Balatro.zip`, then extract `Balatro.zip`.
- It can also be useful to have a look at code from other mod creators. The best place to find them is in the official [Balatro Discord](https://discord.gg/balatro).
