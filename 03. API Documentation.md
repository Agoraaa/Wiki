# API Documentation
## General remarks
All Steamodded APIs are built on a common Object Oriented Programming engine, made with extensibility in mind. As such, they share certain properties and behaviors.
### The constructor
A new object is always created by calling the corresponding class with a single table parameter. Each class may mark different fields as required and provide default values. In any case, you must provide a `key` string, which must be unique. You need not worry about collisions with other mods, as your mod's prefix will be prepended to each `key`. Besides a few exceptions, this is fully internal and not of your interest.
```lua
-- Skeleton for creating an object
SMODS.Class {
	key = 'key',
	other_param = 0,
	loc_txt = {
		-- ...
	},
}
``` 

### Common parameters
- The `name` field is used by the game to identify certain objects, but Steamodded does not make use of it. While it can be used to replicate vanilla effects, it can be ignored for the most part and is not expected to be present.
- Most objects require some display text to be registered. This is the purpose of the `loc_txt` field. You can either provide a single object that will get used for every language, or provide different text for multiple languages. If the selected language is not provided, a fallback `default` field, the English version, or the `loc_txt` table itself will be used as defaults, in that order of priority. The following are examples of valid `loc_txt` tables:
	- `{ name = 'Name', text = { 'This is example text' } }`
	-
	```lua
		{
			['en-us'] = {
				name = 'Name',
				text = { 'Example', 'text', 'on', 'five', 'lines'},
			},
			['fr'] = {
				-- French translation
			},
			['nl'] = {
				-- Dutch translation
			},
			['default'] = {
				-- a different default text
				-- leave this empty to allow
				-- custom languages to provide
				-- their own translation
			}
		}
	```
	-
	```lua
	{
		['en-us'] = {
			-- Sometimes, more text is required than just a name and a description
			label = 'Label',
			description = {
				name = 'Name',
				text = { 'A moderately long', 'description of', 'your effect.' }
			}
		}
	}
	```
- `unlocked` sets the default unlock state of an object. If this is set to `false`, you need to implement an unlock condition for your card to be obtainable.
- `discovered` sets the default discovery state of an object. If this is set to `true`, your card need not be found in a run before it can be viewed in the collection.
- `config` is a reserved table that allows setting initial values kept in a card's `ability` table. Only specific keys are recognized; it is recommended to define an `extra` table inside `config` for advanced functionality.
- `raw_atlas_key` is an optional parameter for all objects that require an `atlas` field. It is needed if you want to reference an atlas from the base game or another mod, as your mod prefix will otherwise be prepended to the atlas key.
```lua
config = {
	extra = {
		custom_value = 10,
		another_value = 'something',
	},
}
```
- `dependencies` allows you to specify one or multiple mods by their respective IDs. Your object will only be loaded when all specified mods are present. This is useful for cross-mod compatibility, but not for dependencies that are required for your mod to function properly. In such cases, add a dependency to your mod header.

### Taking ownership
You may need to modify vanilla objects as part of your mod. To achieve this while providing all of the same API functions as for modded objects, a separate method is used. Each provided key-value pair of the provided table overwrites the previously present value, while the rest of the object is left intact.
```lua
SMODS.Joker:take_ownership('joker', {
	cost = 5,
	calculate = function(card, context)
		-- more on this later
	end
})
```

### API functions
All available API functions are explained in detail on the page for their respective class. The following list establishes parameter names that are used throughout several such interfaces.
| Identifier 	| Meaning 		|
| :--------- 	| :--------- 	|
| `self`		| The table this method is defined on. This is generally a prototype object that can't keep track of state. |
| `card`		| An object of the game's `Card` class. Keeps track of state in an `ability` field. |
