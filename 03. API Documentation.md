# API Documentation
## General remarks
All Steamodded APIs are built on a common Object Oriented Programming engine, made with extensibility in mind. As such, they share certain properties and behaviors.
### The constructor
A new object is always created by calling the corresponding class with a single table parameter. Each class may mark different fields as required and provide default values. In any case, you must provide a `key` string, which must be unique. You need not worry about collisions with other mods, as your mod's prefix will be prepended to each `key`. Besides a few exceptions, this is fully internal and not of your interest.
```lua
-- Skeleton for creating in object
SMODS.Class {
	key = 'key',
	name = 'Name',
	other_param = 0,
}
``` 

### Common parameters
- The `name` field is used by the game to identify certain objects, as such, the game expects it to be present. Steamodded identifies objects by their `key` instead, and this name does not serve as a display name either, so it's mostly useless.
- Most objects require some display text to be registered. This is the purpose of the `loc_txt` field. You can either provide a single object that will get used for every language, or provide different text for multiple languages. If the selected language is not provided, a fallback `default` field, the English version, or the `loc_txt` table itself will be used as defaults, in that order of priority. The following are examples of valid `loc_txt` tables:
	- `{ name = 'Name', text = { 'This is example text' } }`
	-
	```lua
		{
			['en-us'] = {
				name = 'Name',
				text = { 'Example', 'text', 'on', 'five', 'lines'},
			},
			['fr'] = {
				-- French translation
			},
			['nl'] = {
				-- Dutch translation
			},
			['default'] = {
				-- a different default text
				-- leave this empty to allow
				-- custom languages to provide
				-- their own translation
			}
		}
	```
	-
	```lua
	{
		['en-us'] = {
			-- Sometimes, more text is required than just a name and a description
			label = 'Label',
			description = {
				name = 'Name',
				text = { 'A moderately long', 'description of', 'your effect.' }
			}
		}
	}
	```
- `unlocked` sets the default unlock state of an object. If this is set to `false`, you need to implement an unlock condition for your card to be obtainable.
- `discovered` sets the default discovery state of an object. If this is set to `true`, your card need not be found in a run before it can be viewed in the collection.
### Taking ownership
You may need to modify vanilla objects as part of your mod. To achieve this while providing all of the same API functions as for modded objects, a separate method is used. Each provided key-value pair of the provided table overwrites the previously present value, while the rest of the object is left intact.
```lua
SMODS.Joker:take_ownership('joker', {
	cost = 5,
	calculate = function(card, context)
		-- more on this later
	end
})
```

### API functions
All available API functions are explained in detail on the page for their respective class. The following list establishes parameter names that are used throughout several such interfaces.
| Identifier 	| Meaning 		|
| :--------- 	| :--------- 	|
| `self`		| The table this method is defined on. This is generally a prototype object that can't keep track of state. |
| `card`		| An object of the game's `Card` class. Keeps track of state in an `ability` field. |
