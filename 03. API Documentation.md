# API Documentation
## General remarks
All Steamodded APIs are built on a common Object Oriented Programming engine, made with extensibility in mind. As such, they share certain properties and behaviors.
### The constructor
A new object is always created by calling the corresponding class with a single table parameter. Each class may mark different fields as required and provide default values. In any case, you must provide a `key` string, which must be unique. You need not worry about collisions with other mods, as your mod's prefix will be prepended to each `key`. Besides a few exceptions, this is fully internal and not of your interest.
```lua
-- Skeleton for creating in object
SMODS.Class {
	key = 'key',
	name = 'Name',
	other_param = 0,
}
```

### Taking ownership
You may need to modify vanilla objects as part of your mod. To achieve this while providing all of the same API functions as for modded objects, a separate method is used. Each provided key-value pair of the provided table overwrites the previously present value, while the rest of the object is left intact.
```lua
SMODS.Joker:take_ownership('joker', {
	cost = 5,
	calculate = function(card, context)
		-- more on this later
	end
})
```
